<!-- Incident report template for Orcfax

NB. These <!--comment-sections will not render in the final issue report. Use the preview window to provide a view of the final report.

Keep in mind. Headers should be prefixed with '##' (H2) where the title of the issue is (H1).

Newlines should be used liberally, e.g. under headings, and before code-blocks.

Code-blocks should be marked with their syntax type, e.g.

```text
text here...
```

```json
json here...
```

GitHub issues use Markdown syntax, but some markdown rules such as line-wrapping are not observed and so line-breaks should be used sparingly, i.e. do not worry about line-length.
